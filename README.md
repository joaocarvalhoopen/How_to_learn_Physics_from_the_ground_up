# How to learn Physics from the ground up
A Guide to the intrepid adventurer.

## Description

Physics, along side Mathematics are the two foundation bases of all things in science and in engineering, with them you can rip the rewards of understanding a little bit about almost everything. It will give you a direct line to the “language” in which the accumulated and curated human knowledge about the universe is written. It will expose to you many beautiful things about how the universe works, from the very small to the very large. A incredible journey awaits for you. One that you can dive in deep, knowing that there is always more to be learned. This is just a simple guide to help you move around. There is a little bit of Chemistry at the end of this guide.
